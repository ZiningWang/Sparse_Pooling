# Implementation of Sparse Non-homogeneous Pooling on Fusion-based Detection Networks
Sparse Pooling for LIDAR and Camera Fusion by Zining Wang

## Claim

Sparse Pooling is for fusing feature maps from different views and sources. Sparsity comes from the sparse correspondences between cells, such as point cloud. The layer is not only restricted to detection but also useful for segmentation. The main part is based on [**Fusing Bird View LIDAR Point Cloud and Front View Camera Image for Deep Object Detection**](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.06703).

As the majority of the code comes from many existing repositories, including [MV3D_TF](https://github.com/leeyevi/MV3D_TF), [Avod-FPN](https://github.com/kujason/avod), [VoxelNet](https://github.com/jeasinema/VoxelNet-tensorflow) and [MSCNN](https://github.com/zhaoweicai/mscnn). If there is any thing inappropriate, please contact me through wangzining@berkeley.edu.

Results will be updated.


## <a name="id2"></a>Sparse Non-homogeneous Pooling for Feature Map Fusion of LIDAR and Camera
This is the introduction of the extension of the published work [**Fusing Bird View LIDAR Point Cloud and Front View Camera Image for Deep Object Detection**](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.06703). The code is released on the github [Sparse_Pooling](https://github.com/ZiningWang/Sparse_Pooling). The problem considered here is the feature fusion of different sensors in CNNs shown as the figure below

The fusion happens at the middle-stage which is of the best performance according to the Kitti Benchmark on July 23, 2018. The middle-stage fusion propose to fuse features after the convolution and down-sampling operations of the raw data and before the region proposal network (RPN). The fusion keeps the training of the network end-to-end.

The main contributions of the Sparse Non-homogeneous Pooling Layer (SHPL) are:  


### Sparse Pooling Transforms and Preserves the Whole feature map
With the feature map preserved while the information of both sensors are fused, not only detection but also semantic segmentation and other tasks with fused features.  
One-stage detection framework can be utilized without RoI pooling which improves efficiency.  


### Easy to Incorperate with Existing Networks and Very Little Overhead
The following figure shows the integration of SHPL with Avod-FPN. It improves the average precision (AP) by feature fusion, adding a subtle overhead to the mean inference time on the validation dataset.

## Usage
The following two networks can be downloaded and run separately.

`avod` based on [Avod-FPN](https://github.com/kujason/avod) is the additional part. It aims to show that the SHPL can be easily added to other networks to allow efficient fusion of feature maps.

`MV3D_TF_release` is the network introduced in the paper. It fuses [VoxelNet](https://github.com/jeasinema/VoxelNet-tensorflow) and [MSCNN](https://github.com/zhaoweicai/mscnn) and uses focal loss for one-stage detection. 



## Code added/changed
This is for avod.
### Added:  
`core/feature_extractors/fusion_bgg_pyramid.py`:  For fusion right after vgg  
`utils/transform.py`:  Basic utility functions to preprocess input data  
`utils/sparse_pool_utils.py`: Main functions to construct the Sparse Non-homogeneous Pooling Layer

### Changed:
`bev_slices.py`: See code under `#WZN`. Add additional inputs of voxel indices for Sparse Pooling  
`rpn_model.py`:  See code under `#WZN`. Add placeholders and Sparse Pooling layer before rpn (controled by new parameters in config)  
`model.proto`:   Add 5 more parameters to control Sparse Pooling

Here is the change of the structure:
